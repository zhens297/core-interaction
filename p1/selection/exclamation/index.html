    <title>Exclamation Marks</title>

    <p>
    Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also quotation 
    marks, they are unnecessary, they are ugly, they spoil the
    line of the writing or the printing and anyway what is the
    use, if you do not know that a question is a question what
    is the use of its being a question. The same thing is true
    of a quotation. When I first began writing I found it simply
    impossible to use question marks and quotation marks and 
    exclamation points and now anybody sees it that way. Perhaps 
    some day they will see it some other way but not at any rate 
    anybody can and does see it that way.

    So there are the uninteresting things in punctuation uninteresting 
    in a way that is perfectly obvious, and so we do not have to go 
    any farther into that. There are besides dashes and dots, and these 
    might be interesting spaces might be interesting. They might if one 
    felt that way about them.
