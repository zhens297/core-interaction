   <p> Of these the one but the first and the most the completely most 
    uninteresting is the question mark. The question mark is alright when it is 
    all alone when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used 
    in decoration but connected with writing it is completely entirely completely 
    uninteresting. It is evident that is you ask a question you ask a
    question but anybody who can read at all knows when a question
    is a question as it is written in writing. <span class="red"> I ask you 
    therefore wherefore should one use the question mark.</span> Beside 
    it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it 
    pleases neither the eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun,
    just an unnecessary name of something. A question is a question, 
    <span class="red">anybody can know that a question is a question</span> and so why add to it
    the question mark when it is already there when the question is 
    already there in the writing. Therefore I never could bring myself
    to use a question mark, I always found it positively revolting, 
    and now very few do use it.
