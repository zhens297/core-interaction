    <title>Apostrophe</title>

<body>
    One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings 
    about and that is the apostrophe for possession. Well 
    feel as you like about that, I can see and I do see that 
    for many that for some the possessive case apostrophe has 
    a gentle tender insinuation that makes it very difficult 
    to definitely decide to do without it. One does do without 
    it, I do, I mostly always do, but I cannot deny that from 
    time to time I feel myself having regrets and from time to 
    time I put it in to make the possessive case. I absolutely 
    do not like it and leaving it out I feel no regret, there 
    it is unnecessary and not ornamental but inside a word and 
    its s well perhaps, perhaps it does appeal by its weakness 
    to your weakness. At least at any rate from time to time I 
    do find myself letting it alone if it has come in and sometimes 
    it has come in. I cannot positively deny but that I do from time 
    to time let it come in.
